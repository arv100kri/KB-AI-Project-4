********************Dependencies**********************
This project assumes that the following python libraries are installed:
1. SciPy	http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/0.11.0/
2. NumPy	http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.7.0b2/
3. PIL (Python Imaging Library)	http://effbot.org/downloads/#pil

Also python-2.7 is the preferred interpreter.

*******************Running the project*********************
1. The program to be run is "Arvind_Krishnaa_Jagannathan_Project_4.py"
2. Run the project as
	python Arvind_Krishnaa_Jagannathan_Project_4.py
3. The program runs and prints out the answer to each problem.
4. Replace the empty placeholder directories (11 and 12) in the Representation directory with those present in the zip file, submitted in this assignment.
5. The project needs a little time (a few seconds) to begin since the libraries need to be initialized but the program runs normally after.

******************Project Structure*************************
1. "Arvind_Krishnaa_Jagannathan_Project_4.py" the main executable
2. Representations - directory with the Visual representation of each problem
3. Generated_Propositional_Representations - directory which contains the simple propositions extracted out of the visual representations. This is generated at run time.
4. Source Code - the Python code for the analogy solver

NOTE: Any Warnings in the Console can be ignored. The summary of the results will be printed in the end

Since there were differences in the solutions obtained in project 3 between the TA and me, I am attaching the snapshot of the console, as the file screenshot.png
